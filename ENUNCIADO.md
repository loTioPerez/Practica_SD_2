Scalable and Elastic Ticket Service (AWS Managed Systems)
1. Objective
Design and implement a distributed ticket-selling system using managed AWS services.

Your system must:

Ensure correctness under concurrency

Implement dynamic (elastic) scaling

Provide reliable performance measurements
2. Functional Requirements
You must support two ticket modes:

A. Unnumbered Tickets
Maximum: 100,000 tickets

No overselling allowed

B. Numbered Tickets
Seats: 1–100,000

Each seat can be sold at most once

👉 You must explicitly define:

Your consistency model (strong vs eventual)

How you prevent race conditions

3. Architecture Constraints
Your system must include:

✔ Asynchronous Processing (Mandatory)
Use a queue such as:

RabbitMQ in a EC2 VM

This is required for:

Load smoothing

Decoupling components

✔ Stateless Workers
Use one of:

AWS Lambda

AWS Fargate

✔ Persistent Storage
Choose one:

Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon RDS

👉 You must justify:

Consistency guarantees

Transaction model

4. Realism Requirement
To simulate real-world systems:

Each buy transaction must include an artificial delay of 100 ms

This models external payment processing latency

The delay must be applied inside the worker processing logic

👉 This must be considered in:

Throughput calculations

Scaling decisions

 

5. Dynamic Scaling (Core Requirement)
You must implement scaling logic based on measured system load.

Suggested models:

Speedup

S = T_1 / T_N

Where:

S = Speedup
T_1 = Execution time with a single worker (or single processor)
TN ​ = Execution time with N workers (or processors)
 

Scaling based on arrival rate

N = (λ * T) / C

Where:

N = Number of workers required
λ = Arrival rate of messages (messages per second)
T = Average processing time per message (seconds per message)
C = Capacity of a single worker (messages per second)
Alternatively, if backlog is considered:

Scaling based on backlog

N = (B + λ * T_r) / C

Where:

B = Current queue backlog (messages waiting to be processed)
T_r = Target response time (seconds)
 

 You must:

estimate parameters experimentally
map this to:
Lambda concurrency OR
ECS/Fargate scaling

 

6. Elastic Workload 
You must design a time-varying workload Z(t) that demonstrates system elasticity.

The workload must include:

Low load phase

Gradual ramp-up

Sudden spikes

Sustained high load

Cool-down phase

👉 Your system must:

Scale up and down dynamically

Avoid over-provisioning

Maintain correctness during scaling

7. Stress Testing & Capacity Analysis
you must perform stress tests to determine:

Maximum throughput per node

Saturation point

Performance degradation behavior

👉 You must:

Gradually increase load until instability appears

Identify:

Bottlenecks

Queue buildup

Latency growth

8. High Contention Scenario
You must evaluate:

A. Uniform Load
Requests evenly distributed

B. Hotspot Load
80% of requests target 5% of seats

👉 This reveals:

Lock contention

Partition hotspots (especially in DynamoDB)

9. Throughput & Metrics Measurement (IMPORTANT)
A common mistake is measuring throughput incorrectly at the server.

✅ Required approach:
Each successfully processed request must be recorded in:

A queue OR

A database/log structure

You must track:

Start time of the experiment

Completion time (when all requests finish)

From this, compute:
Throughput = completed requests / total time

Latency distribution (p50, p95, p99)

End-to-end processing time

👉 Important:

Do NOT rely only on client-side timing

Measurements must reflect completed transactions only

10. Fault Tolerance Requirements
You must implement:

Worker failure
Idempotency (request_id)
Retry safety (at-least-once semantics)
Dead-letter queues (SQS DLQ)
Failure handling 
11. Infrastructure as Code (Optional)
You must define your infrastructure using:

AWS CDK (recommended)
OR
AWS CloudFormationOR
Terraform
👉 Requirement:

One command deployment
No manual setup
 
12. Optional Components
🔁 Pub/Sub (Advanced)
Amazon SNS
Only if:

Multi-stage pipelines OR

Separate analytics/logging

🚫 Not allowed as queue replacement

📦 Storage / Logging
Amazon S3

📊 Monitoring 
Amazon CloudWatch

15. Conceptual Questions (To Be Answered in the Report)
Q1. Consistency vs Scalability Trade-off
In your system design:

What consistency model did you choose and why?

How would your system behavior change if you switched to a weaker/stronger model?

What is the impact on correctness and performance?

Q2. Fault Tolerance vs Performance Trade-offs
How do retries, idempotency, and failure handling affect performance?

What overheads could fault tolerance introduce?

Is there a point where increased reliability significantly reduces throughput?
